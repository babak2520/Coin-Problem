# Coin-Problem
Just for fun project

A code for pulling statistics for the following math problem:

You have a box with N coins inside of it. The coins are numbered from 1 to N. You play a game; for every iteration of the game, 
you pull coins out of the box randomly until it's empty. For every iteration, you make a total amount of money equal to: 
the value of the first coin extracted, plus the absolute value of the difference between each subsequent coin extraction
and the one previous to it.
Example: N=4 and the following is the drawing order: 3, 1, 4, 2 ==> Total Money Made = 3 + |3-1| + |1-4| + |4-2| = 10
